# 🔬 Custom 4-bit ALU — CMOS to FPGA Implementation

> **Complete RTL-to-Silicon Design Flow | 130nm CMOS | Verilog HDL | Vivado FPGA**

This project presents a fully custom 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) designed from the transistor level using 130nm CMOS technology, synthesized to gate-level Verilog, and implemented on FPGA hardware.

---

## Overview

This project simulates the **full hardware development pipeline**, starting from transistor-level CMOS design and moving through Verilog RTL development, simulation, synthesis, and finally hardware verification using FPGA.

We designed and tested each module in 3 layers:
- **CMOS-level** logic gates (schematic and layout)
- **Verilog RTL** modules for ALU datapath
- **FPGA simulation & testbenches** for timing and correctness

## Learned :

📘 **CMOS Design Principles** — Transistor sizing, symmetry, layout compaction  
🧮 **Modular RTL Architecture** — Clean layering of arithmetic, logic, and control  
🧪 **Verification Flow** — Edge-case coverage, randomized testbenches, and assertions  
🖥️ **FPGA Toolchain** — RTL to bitstream flow in **Vivado Design Suite**

## Timing Closure 

Analyzed and optimized the following key timing parameters:

- **Setup Time**: Ensuring data is stable *before* the active clock edge
- **Hold Time**: Ensuring data remains stable *after* the clock edge
- **T<sub>cq</sub> (Clock-to-Q Delay)**: Time for data to appear at the output after clock edge
- **T<sub>dq</sub> (Data Propagation Delay)**: Time from input D to Q output (for FF or combinational path)
- **Clock Skew**: Variation in clock arrival time across flip-flops
- **Jitter**: Uncertainty in clock edges due to noise or variation

Timing closure was achieved by:
- Pipelining the datapath using synchronous **D Flip-Flops**
- Optimizing critical path delays in the **adder and multiplier**
- Analyzing Vivado timing reports and refining clock constraints
